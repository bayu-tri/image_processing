1. [Negative filter](https://github.com/fayis672/image_processing-basics/tree/main/image_filters/negative) <br/>
The negative of an image with gray levels in the range [0, L-1] is
obtained by using the negative transformation, which is given by the
expression
``` s = L - 1 - r ```
Reversing the intensity levels of an image in this manner produces the equivalent of a
photographic negative. This type of processing is particularly suited for enhancing white
or gray detail embedded in dark regions of an image, especially when the black areas are
dominant in size.
